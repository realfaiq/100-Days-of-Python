As I'm getting started with ML and DS. I will start coding python for 100 days from the very basic of it. <br />
Day-1: Variables and Data-Types in python. Both Primitive and Non-Primitive. <br />
Day-2: Operator, Operands Expressions and Input in Python. <br />
Day-3: Control Flow, Lists and Sets. <br />
Day-4: Strings and Common Data  Structures in Python. <br />
Day-5: Looping in Python. For and While Loop. <br />
Day-6: Functions in Python. User Defined and Built-in. <br />
Day-7: Revised the Concepts done by solving codewars exercises. <br />
Day-8: Object Oriented Programming. Classes, Instances, Decorators, Magic Methods, Inheritance.
Day-9: Dived Deeper into the concepts of OOP. Covered the four basic pillars i.e. Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. <br />
Day-10: Revised the concepts of OOP in particular class, variables, methods, inheritance. <br />
Day-11: Revised the concepts of Inheritance and went deep into the concepts like inhertiance, multiple inheritance, class explosions, duck typing, composition, mixins, inheritance vs compostion. <br />
Day-12: Revised all the concepts of OOP studied this week. <br />
Day-13: Solved Codewar Exercise to further strengthesize my knowledge and logic building. <br />
Day 14: Solved more codewar exercises and revised the OOP Concepts. <br />
Day-15: Started working on the Data-Science Library Project. <br />
Day-16: Learned and Practiced NumPy Library. <br />
Day-17: Started Learning Pandas Library. <br />
Day-18: Moved on with learning Pandas. Learned about Filtering and updating rows and columns. <br />
Day-19: Learned how to play with rows and columns in Pandas. <br />
Day-20: Learned and Practiced about Aggregation and Grouping of Data with Data Cleaning. <br />
Day-21: Worked with Time Series Data using Pandas. Also Learned how to read and write to different types of file formats with pandas and getting started with data visualization using matplotlib. <br />
Day-22: Moved more into Data Visualization. Learned MatplotLib and Seaborn Libraries to visualize different kaggle datasets. <br />
